//! ## The unsigned phase, and its miner.
//!
//! This pallet deals with unsigned submissions. These are backup, "possibly" multi-page submissions
//! from validators.
//!
//! This pallet has two miners, described in [`unsigned::miner`].
//!
//! As it stands, a validator can, during the unsigned phase, submit up to
//! [`unsigned::Config::MinerPages`] pages. While this can be more than 1, it can likely not be a
//! full, high quality solution. This is because unsigned validator solutions are verified on the
//! fly, all within a single block. The exact value of this parameter should be determined by the
//! benchmarks of a runtime.
//!
//! We could implement a protocol to allow multi-block, multi-page collaborative submissions from
//! different validators, but it is not trivial. Moreover, recall that the unsigned phase is merely
//! a backup and we should primarily rely on offchain staking miners to fulfill this role during
//! `Phase::Signed`.
//!
//! ## Future Idea: Multi-Page unsigned submission
//!
//! the following is the idea of how to implement multi-page unsigned, which we don't have.
//!
//! All validators will run their miners and compute the full paginated solution. They submit all
//! pages as individual unsigned transactions to their local tx-pool.
//!
//! Upon validation, if any page is now present the corresponding transaction is dropped.
//!
//! At each block, the first page that may be valid is included as a high priority operational
//! transaction. This page is validated on the fly to be correct. Since this transaction is sourced
//! from a validator, we can panic if they submit an invalid transaction.
//!
//! Then, once the final page is submitted, some extra checks are done, as explained in
//! [`crate::verifier`]:
//!
//! 1. bounds
//! 2. total score
//!
//! These checks might still fail. If they do, the solution is dropped. At this point, we don't know
//! which validator may have submitted a slightly-faulty solution.
//!
//! In order to prevent this, the transaction validation process always includes a check to ensure
//! all of the previous pages that have been submitted match what the local validator has computed.
//! If they match, the validator knows that they are putting skin in a game that is valid.
//!
//! If any bad paged are detected, the next validator can bail. This process means:
//!
//! * As long as all validators are honest, and run the same miner code, a correct solution is
//!   found.
//! * As little as one malicious validator can stall the process, but no one is accidentally
//!   slashed, and no panic happens.
//!
//! Alternatively, we can keep track of submitters, and report a slash if it occurs. Or, if
//! the signed process is bullet-proof, we can be okay with the status quo.
